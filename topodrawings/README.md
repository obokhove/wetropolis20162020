## Topography of landscape 

**_Check second NFM-Wetropolis topography_**
Monday 04-03-2019 Hand-measurements of mid-channel slope of polystyrene topography 2017 Wetropolis NFM plates. Using a simple handruler after levelling the set-up with a horizontal level, for both the foam-bounding box and the fitted foams themselves.

| 8 | 3.5 |- | arc 2nd bend | 
| 9 | 4.0 | - | opposite 0.2m from inflow pt & pt 7 | 
| 10| 4.3 |0.01 | 0.3m downstream from pt 9 |

| 14| 5.25 |0.0094 | entrance city 0.16m downstream from pt 13 |
| 15| 5.55 |0.0071 | end city 0.42m downstream pt 14 | 
| 16| 5.65 |- | middle straight of exit bends |
| 17| 6.8 | - | exit |

In conclusion the slope of the main channel is pretty close to 1:100. Overall drop is 5.5cm over 4.2 or more meters, whcih is about 0.0131 slope.

Topography of landscape 

Monday 05-0-2019 Hand-measurements of mid-channel slope of polystyrene topography 2017 Qetropolis NFM plates  Using a simple handruler after levelling the set-up with a leveler, of both the box and the foams.

| Point | height (mm) +-1mm | comment |
----------------------------------------
| 1 | 1.3 | 0.02m from inflow circle | 
| 2 | 1.8 | 0.3m from inflow point | 
| 3 | 2.05 | | 0.6m from inflow point | 
| 4 | 2.2 | 0.75m from inflow point | 
| 5 | 2.4 | middle 1st bend | 
| 6 | 2.6 | past ar opposite to 0.75m pt 4| 
| 7 | 3.3 | oppositie 0.2m from inflow pt | 
| 8 | 3.5 | arc 2nd bend | 
| 9 | 4.0 | opposite 0.2m from inflow pt & pt 7 | 
| 10| 4.3 | 0.3m downstream from pt 9 | 
| 11| 4.5 | 0.6m downstream from pt 9 | 
| 12| 4.9 | arc 3d bend | 
| 13| 5.1 | opposite 0.6m downstream so of pt 11 | 
| 14| 5.25 | enttrance city 0.16m downstream from pt 13 |
| 15| 5.55 | end city 0.42m downstream pt 14 | 
| 16| 5.65 | middle straight of exit bends |
| 17| 6.8 | exit |

In conclusion the slope of the main channel is pretty close to 1:100.

# Wetropolis Flood Demonstrator Quiz: questions and answers

## Welcome to the Wetropolis Quiz on extreme rainfall and river flooding! Work together?

Q1: How long does it (approximately) take for the steel ball to fall through the Galtonboard(s)?

a) 1 second; b) 10 seconds; or, c) 100 seconds?

That is the length of a day in Wetropolis, a Wetropolis day —with new SI unit wd.

ANSWER: b) The Wetropolis day or wd is 10 seconds.


Q2: Notice which two lights light up on the Galton board(s) during a wd (Wetropolis day)and notice what happens in the river set-up with rain falling on the moor and reservoir.

When the lights in channels “2 seconds” and “moor” lit up, what happens in the set-up?

a) Rain falls for 4s in the reservoir; b) there is no rain; c) rain falls for 2s in the moor. 

ANSWER: c) Rain falls for 2 seconds in the moor (the box with the porous particles representing a porous peat moor, say).


Q3: There are 4 rain duration outcomes (that is: 1s,2s,4s,9s of rainfall per wd) and 4 rain location outcomes (that is: rainfall in reservoir, in reservoir & moor, in moor, no rain).

What is the most extreme rainfall event possible during one Wetropolis day?

a) No rainfall; b) 9s in moor; c) 9s in reservoir & moor; d) 9s in reservoir.

Locate the city in the set-up. Next observe Wetropolis over several Wetropolis days and notice that the city (only) starts to flood after such an extreme rainfall event. On average you will have to wait for a certain number of Wetropolis days, the return period, for flooding to occur.

ANSWER: c) 9s of rainfall in both the reservoir and moor.


Q4: When an extreme event is seen to occur aftre a steel ball falls through the Galtonboard(s), what can you do the lessen or prevent the city from flooding?

a) Hold back water in reservoir by using its lock gates; b) nothing; c) hold back water in reservoir by using lock gates after first (sufficiently slowly, why?) emptying it during “dry” times.

ANSWER: c) By first emptying the reservoir without flooding the city during sufficiently dry Wetropolis days one can create more volume in the reservoir to store rainfall, but only till the reservoir is full. So answer c) is better than answer a).


Q5) During climate change more (annual or Wetropolis) rainfall is predicted. Find the climate-change rainfall switch; turn it on and observe what happens.

ANSWER: See the red switch sticking out of the wooden lid.


Q6: The water volume that floods the city is the flood-excess volume: collect and measure that volume underneath the city by turning the valve off/on under the city (and play!)

The Wetropolis Event Probability (WEP) is thus circa 2.73%, the analog of the Annual Event Probability (AEP used by the Environment Agency in flood-risk maps for your house. The EA uses 1/30=3.3%, 1/100=1% and 1/1000=0.1% flood-risk thresholds -see https://check-long-term-flood-risk.service.gov.uk/postcode

Q7: In the ideal case of 50%-50% splits on the Galtonboard, what is distribution in the 4 Galtonboard channels?

Hint: first split 1/2 & 1/2; 2nd split: 3/4 & 1/4; 3rd split: 3/8 & 1/2 & 1/8; final split and answer: 3/16 & 7/16 & … & 1/16.

Answer (see poster): 3/16 & 7/16 & ... & 1/16.

ANSWER: 3/16 & 7/16 & 5/16 & 1/16 (on average).


Q8: How often does such an extreme rainfall event occur? What is its chance of occurrence?

a) 1/16 x 7/16=7/256; b) 1/16; c) 5/16x5/16=25/256; d) 7/16x1/16=7/256. (See poster.)

ANSWER: a) 1/16 x 7/16=7/256;


Q9: Extreme rainfall occurs circa 3% (2.73% to be more precise) of the time on average.

What is then the return period for such an extreme flood event?

a) 256/7~36wd’s or 6:06min; b) 120wd’s or 20min; c) 16wd’s or 160s. (See poster.)

ANSWER: a) 256/7~36wd’s or 6:06min with 36x10s=6min.


Q10: How do the two Galtonboard distributions approximate their ideal distributions?

Answer: see the outcome (updates) on the Raspberry Pi (move the mouse and look at the serial monitor; printed lines with numbers per channel, normalised and ideal outcomes). What can we do to improve the outcomes?

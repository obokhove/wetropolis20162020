# Wetropolis feedback

## Churchtown Flood Action Group  21-12-2019
From Siriol Hogg Vice Chairman of Churchtown Flood Action Group. Administrator of Lancashire Flood Action Groups. 
"Dear Onno, 

Obviously I would like to help you in any way that I can. When  you gave your talk at the original Conference that I organised, I thought, despite its complexity you made it understandable through the use of the Westropolis model. But I only have GCSE Maths, so I just couldnâ€™t understand the more complex calculations.  I think I got the gist of your talk about Risk. I did learn  from your talk that modelling is not an exact Science, because there are so many variables, to take into account. It is obvious that any system that makes the calculation of the risk of flooding more accurate is to be desired, especially in the present climate, when the flood risk assessments are in the hands of the people who produce them for their own use. The people who critiqued your article obviously have a greater understanding of what you are doing than I do. I am presuming that the Scientific Journal  will not accept your article without some adjustments? 
The feedback that I have had from lay people is that your talk was enjoyable and the  Wetropolis demonstration was interesting and informative. 
Regards, Siriol"

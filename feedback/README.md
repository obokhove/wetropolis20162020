# Wetropolis feedback

## Feedback from Churchtown Flood Action Group 21-12-2019
The Churchtown Flood Action Group won the Environment Agency Project Excellence Award in 2018 and is the foremost Flood Action Group in Lancashire.

"Dear Onno, 

Obviously I would like to help you in any way that I can. When you gave your talk at the original Conference [January 2017] that I organised, I thought, despite its complexity you made it understandable through the use of the Westropolis model. But I only have GCSE Maths, so I just couldn’t understand the more complex calculations. I think I got the gist of your talk about Risk. I did learn from your talk that modelling is not an exact Science, because there are so many variables, to take into account. It is obvious that any system that makes the calculation of the risk of flooding more accurate is to be desired, especially in the present climate, when the flood risk assessments are in the hands of the people who produce them for their own use. The people who critiqued your article obviously have a greater understanding of what you are doing than I do. I am presuming that the Scientific Journal will not accept your article without some adjustments? 
The feedback that I have had from lay people is that your talk was enjoyable and the Wetropolis demonstration was interesting and informative. 

Regards, Siriol"

*Reaction*:
- Modelling is a(n exact) science. However, due to the chaotic nature of weather prediction and lack of uncertainty in the input parameters, as well as insufficient measurements and measurement erors, predictions have (a large) uncertainty, certainly long-term and climate predictions. Modelling is the science that includes dealing with such uncertainty.
- Indeed, publication in journals is an iterative process and in revisions one can address comments of the reviewers.

## Feedback from Armley Museum 03-01-2020
“Wetropolis was utilised at a science event at Leeds Industrial Museum to complement an exhibition reflecting the community’s experience of the 2015 floods in the city. Being able to show the public how the flood occurred through the Wetropolis model certainly assisted the layperson’s  understanding of how the flooding occurred, making the mathematics of flooding accessible to a wider audience.”
Chris Sharp, Assistant Community Curator, Leeds Industrial Museum.


## Feedback from Turing Gateway 28-12-2019
Wetropolis was displayed during the Environmental Modelling in Industry Study Group (April 2017 at the Isaac Newton Gateway to Mathematics in Cambridge) https://gateway.newton.ac.uk/event/tgmw41 with the following feedback “... the addition of the Wetropolis flood demonstrator on Wednesday attracted a lot of attention and interaction”.

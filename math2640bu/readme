Note that that the bordered Hessian with positive B and B^T has the same properties as the one derived from the Lagrangian
since multiplying the first m rows and the first m columns by -1 is an even 2m- operation such that the properties of
the Lagrangian do not change. The properties of the Hessian also do not change,
at least for linear constraints, when they are multiplied by a factor 2 or 1/2, or vice versa if (elements) H are multiplied
by 2 or 1/2.

The story of Wetropolis Flood demonstrator by Onno Bokhove

While compilating the design files, I searched through my email accounts and realised how the Wetropolis idea gradually grew to a definite design in a couple of email exchanges with Wout Zweers as well as to two or three presentations:
- one ``Managing Risk in an Age of Extremes'' at the Science of Flood workshop on May 8th 2016 in Hebden Bridge --see the file hebdenbrigde2016 -copy.pdf Notice the first design sketch on page 18 and that the final design became quite different.
- one ``'On the science of floods: rainfall, flooding and flood control revisited in the design of a table-top model' at Imperial College on 01-06-2016, where the first completed mathematical and numerical desig model was revealed --see the file reading1J2016.pdf
At this seminar, I ran the matlab simulation at the end of the seminar for 100 Wetropolis days, i.e. 1000s real time, which is about 100s computational time. While there shoudl be 2.73 extreme events on average over 100 wd's, in that simulation it was not till day 99 that the first extreme rainfall event and flooding happened. Meanwhile I was babbling for 99s for the extreme event to appears, sweating buckts thinking that I had set up the simulation incorrectly. Then on day 100, bang, the extreme flooding event flooded the city. "Did you keep us in suspense on purpose, had you arrange this", I recall prof Dayl Holm asking. "Sure", I said, and smiled: "I did not. I was swaeting buckets that something went wrng but, hey, that is probability for you". I think I saved a screen shot of this simulation with one spike on wd 99.
